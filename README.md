# BuyNothingMatcherApp - Android

This mobile app was inspired by the [Buy Nothing Project](https://buynothingproject.org/) to help facilitate the cycling of resources within a community. The app connects to a Java Springboot API hosted on a Google Cloud Virtual Machine. 


This is a capstone project for [Ada Developers Academy](https://www.adadevelopersacademy.org/) that was completed over the course of 3 weeks.
